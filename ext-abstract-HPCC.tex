% Abstract 
\begin{abstract}
The HPC Carpentry project aims to develop highly interactive workshop training materials to empower novice users of HPC resources to effectively leverage HPC to solve scientific and technical problems of interest to them. Modeled after the Carpentries' training programs, the workshop setting provides learners with a hands-on experience that elicits confidence in their ability to work with the system and sufficient vocabulary and review materials to make subsequent self-study more effective.

The project's most recent focus has been on developing workshop materials that take learners from the command-line shell (using the existing Software Carpentry's Unix Shell lesson), followed by our Introduction to HPC lesson, covering remote access and resource management, and then to a lesson on HPC workflow management, which walks learners through the specification and execution of a scaling study on an HPC system, emphasizing both the benefits and limitations of HPC systems for domain applications. This workshop program was recently run in full at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.

The project plans to develop additional training resources for HPC developers, which will give instructors the option of replacing the workflow lesson with lessons on parallel frameworks, such as MPI.

In a major milestone, the current steering committee is leading the project through the formal incubation process towards becoming an official Carpentries lesson program alongside the existing Software, Data, and Library Carpentry programs.
