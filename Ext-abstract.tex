The project paves the way for the potential users from non-traditional HPC disciplines and non-HPC disciplines to tap into HPC resources for their potential data analysis, modeling, and simulation needs while remaining relevant for beginners from the traditional HPC disciplines.

Previous workshops were held at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, University College Dublin, Brac University, Helmholtz Einstein International Berlin Research School in Data Science (HEIBRiDS), University of Mauritius, Florida International University, Delft University of Technology, National Institute of Standards and Technology, and EPFL CECAM.
