% Abstract 
\begin{abstract}
The HPC Carpentry lesson program is a highly interactive, hands-on approach to getting users up to speed on HPC cluster systems. It is motivated by the increasing availability of cluster resources to a wide range of user groups, many of whom come from communities that have not traditionally used HPC systems.
% AR I am thinking of bio users here, principally.
We adopt the Carpentries approach to pedagogy, which consists of a workshop setting where learners type along with instructors while working through the instructional steps, building up ``muscle memory'' of the tasks, further reinforced by challenge exercises at critical points within the lesson. 
This paper reviews the development of the HPC Carpentry Lesson Program as it becomes the first entrant into phase 2 of The Carpentries Lesson Program Incubator. This incubator is the pathway for HPC Carpentry to become an official lesson program of The Carpentries.
